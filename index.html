            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Krusty Burgers was founded by the star of The Krusty Clown Show, Krusty The Clown. <br>
                During the Summer of 1984, Krusty Burger launched a promotion that gave free burgers to those who pick Olympic Events won by the United States on their game cards. The games involved in the promotion were games that were traditionally won by the Russians. Unfortunately for Krusty, the Russians boycott the Olympics, and the United States won almost every event, costing him $44 million. He then vows on camera to spit on every fiftieth burger as a result of his loss with Homer in particular "liking those odds" when hearing this.
